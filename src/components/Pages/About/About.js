                Hi! I am Razu, a web developer focused on crafting great web experiences. Problem solving and Coding have been my passion since the days I started working with computers but I found myself in web development in 2022. I enjoy creating beautifully designed, intuitive and functional websites.
            </p>
            <p>
                My future plan is to be a MERN stack web developer and to be good at DSA and Problem-solving.
